<button>Hello</button>

<p>
    Paragraph of text.
    What if I wrote another line here?<br>
    I'll have to add a "br" tag for it to actually show up on another line. <br>
    Like this for example.
</p>

<a href="https://www.youtube.com">Link to YouTube</a>
<!-- button, p, a etc. are all HTML tags-->
<!--href is an HTML Attribute, an Attribute modifies how an element behaves-->

<br>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com" target="_blank">Link to YouTube ---- (open in another tab)</a>
<!-- Every HTML element (tag) has it's own set of attributes -->
